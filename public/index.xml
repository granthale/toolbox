    <title>Andy&#039;s prompt writing principles</title>
    <link>https://toolbox.com/Notes/Andy's-prompt-writing-principles</link>
    <guid>https://toolbox.com/Notes/Andy's-prompt-writing-principles</guid>
    <description>One of the more thoughtful resources on Prompt writing principles for flashcards is Andy Matuschak’s How to write good prompts. According to him, prompts should be: Focused Only include one detail Precise Make clear what the prompt is looking for “poorly written prompts require that you also memorize what the prompt is asking” Consistent The same answer should be retrieved every time This doesn’t mean the same exact words, but the same concept/idea should be activated each time Tractable You should almost always answer prompts correctly Effortful Takes effort to retrieve from memory Encoded thoroughly (I like this conceptual framework a lot) Attributes / tendencies Similarities and differences Parts and wholes Causes and effects Significance and implications Useful strategies: The explanation prompt Asking why something is the case The creative prompt Give an answer you haven’t given before The salience prompt Encode “hooks” that spark information at the right times .</description>

    <description>In trying to answer How important is it to create your own Anki prompts? it’s clear that for all the benefits of an Anki copilot, there are potential downsides: Abusing LLMs can handicap our critical thinking ability Starting with an LLM can rob us of a valuable opportunity to grapple with material and come up with questions ourselves Hallucinations exist, making answers less trustworthy Some believe that this could keep us sharper How can we direct LLM-powered SRS towards what we want to learn about? How can we redirect it in the direction that we want to go? Designing a system will be about making the proper tradeoffs.</description>

    <title>Defining Modernity</title>

    <description>After having provided some Food for thought about Papua New Guinea we have meandered our way to thinking about modernity and development. Some meta-questions we could keep at the back of our minds when thinking about this topic could include: What actually is development and how can definitions and perceptions differ? Do all countries and people strive toward modernity? What is anti-modernity? Is development an inherently Western-centric construct? Furthermore, when treating definitions, Context is essential when creating definitions.</description>
