              consistently creating.

                There are increasingly few, low stakes ways for young people to make interest,

                <ol>

              Ideally, <strong>who</strong> you do this for is your current or past self. This is a
              space that <strong>you</strong> would have personally wanted to exist earlier in your
              journey.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Consistent, creative work can be isolating</strong></p>
            <p>
              This might sound familiar. You go to a school where most conversations are subtle
              competitions around grades or internships. Or you come home from a long day of work,
              only to relax by watching a treadmill of information that never gets less urgent.
              Although these are totally fine to do, they often become things that people don’t
              actively choose for themselves. Personal intention feels like it is in increasingly
              short supply.
            </p>
            <p>
              But a small (or big) rebellious spark nudges you. You tinker, trial hobbies, or even
              set off on side quests. You brush by a few people along the way, but you’re mostly
              doing it alone.
              <strong
                >Wanting to break off and explore/make/create in a culture that doesn’t, is
                inherently isolating - this loneliness shouldn’t be the reason great people don’t do
                great things.</strong
              >

            <p>
              The myth of the lone genius enforces this isolation, with stories of great scientists
              and artists that hunker down, sit in rooms surrounded by books, and emerge with grand
              discoveries. If they could do it, why can’t I? Then the isolation and loneliness
              doesn’t seem so bad - it’s a part of the process right? Especially if how hard you’re
              trying is measured by how much

              But what we talk about less, are the supporting squads that usually make this boundary
              pushing work possible.

              In the words of author Michael P. Farrell, “extraordinary creativity is often the
              result of successful collaboration among peers who develop an intense friendship and
              work together on similar projects for an extended period of time”. History makes a
              compelling case for this. We see echoes of this in the French Impressionists; Sigmund
              Freud and his friends; C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, Mary Shelley and the Inklings;
              social reformers Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony; the Fugitive poets; and
              the writers Joseph Conrad and Ford Maddox Ford. In engineering and the sciences, the
              Homebrew Computer Club and Vienna Circle.

              It’s not just the physical act of working alongside someone (although we do encourage
              it), but it’s emotional and intellectual companionship. It’s having people around you
              doing similar things, to discuss, encourage, and critique your approach.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Then, things start to get really exciting.</strong> You have people to share
              wins, work through losses, and brainstorm with. Even if you’re working on something
              completely different, there’s someone also exploring alongside you. How they push
              themselves, nudges you to be better. How you push yourself, encourages them to do the
              same.

              Dedicating time and being vocal about what you care about becomes a bat signal,
              attracting the best conversations of your life and some really great friends. It feels
              like you’re growing into yourself, rendering your self-image in high resolution. This
              is the feeling we want to facilitate.
            </p>
            <p>
              The cycle doesn’t just feed into itself. When done right, it makes people better, in
              the ways they want to be. :)

              There are a couple of phrases we’re guilty of repeating (and repeating). It helps
              communicate what we value in a succinct way.
            </p>
            <p>To ourselves</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>“We’re not married to the format, we’re married to what works”</strong> -
                The point of running anything is to engineer a <em>feeling</em>. It’s the feeling of
                being excited about what’s possible, and relief that you’ve found kind, curious
                people to share the potential with. That may or may not be tied to a format, but
                we’re not stuck in formalities. We encourage experimentation week to week. If
                co-working doesn’t work, try a different format!
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>“Accommodations are not a burden”</strong> - It sucks to feel like an
                outsider based on needs or circumstances. Going the extra mile to accommodate a
                small group also often makes things better for everyone. For example, ramped
                sidewalks and accessible web design.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Keep events free and accessible</strong>- No one should ever be held
                    back by a price tag. Always be on the lookout for unexpected or hidden financial
                    barriers (i.e. transportation costs, event times) that can come with events as
                    well, and brainstorm creative ways to mitigate them.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>“Effort-gate.”</strong> - Start with low barriers to entry and reward those
                that show up consistently. For example, prioritizing recurring attendees for demos
                or hosting opportunities.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>To others</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>“You have permission to get started. We permission you”</strong> - The first
                time you do things can be scrappy and imperfect, the most important thing is to
                start! Can’t register for a venue? Do it in a public place. Find an unlocked
                classroom, building lobby, or park. The most important thing is gathering great
                people together, and everything else will follow, we promise.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>“Do work you care about”</strong> - Create the things you want to exist in
                the world, especially if it’s taking a backseat. People are perceptive - if you work
                on things important to you, it’ll encourage others to do the same!
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>“Everyone is a host”</strong> - Environments get better when everyone feels
                responsible for making things enjoyable. Some people even feel
                <strong>more</strong> comfortable when they feel like they have a little role. Give
                everyone a chance to be responsible!
              </li>
