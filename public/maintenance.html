              Beyond fostering spaces for amazing work, longevity should be one of the primary areas
              of focus for nodes. Being able to identify and nurture relationships with other
              awesome people who will carry the torch for the community is incredibly important, and
              making sure you’ve set out a plan for how the node will last beyond you is essential!

              To some extent, this document originated from the work existing hosts did to make sure
              incoming hosts would be able to run and scale sessions without dealing with any loss
              of context. So much of the work that goes into Socratica is experimental, and a great
              handoff allows us to try more things while banking on a foundation of tried and tested
              principles.

                First, form an incoming team! The host role is a fair amount of commitment, and it’s
                always valuable to have more than two hosts at any given time, especially when
                accounting for weekend travel plans, midterms and academic commitments, and general
                availability.
              </li>
              <li>
                Handoff needs to happen early — the more time you give new hosts to get used to the
                additional responsibility, the better. Ideally, new hosts attend the last couple
                sessions of the previous term to get an idea of the basic responsibilities of
                running sessions (food ordering, location set up, etc.) without having to worry
                about remembering everything.

            <p>
              For many, the first mistake is to focus too much on having funding before running a
              session. Our point here is that you <strong>don’t</strong> need much more than space,
              cool people &amp; friends, and good vibes. Back when Socratica Toronto was first
              getting started, it was ten friends, too many cookies, and the food court. We could
              have skipped the cookies and it would have still been great. Anyways, an event doesn’t
              have to have all the bells and whistles to be a good one; it just needs to be
              memorable to the people who are there. Money can be an excellent way to add to your
              events, but it is in no way a prerequisite: often, having financial infrastructure,
              sponsors, a full process for raising funds, and everything associated with it can
              actually be a hindrance to running good events.
            </p>
            <p>
              TL;DR- don’t let yourself get overly serious in the beginning; raise money when it’s
              absolutely, unequivocally necessary to add to your events.
            </p>
            <p>
              All that being said, if exploring funding options sounds like a good idea for your
              node, here are some ideas that have worked well for us in the past:
            </p>

                <p><strong>Potential Donor: Venture firms</strong></p>

                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Incentive: Lots of amazing things come out of universities and likely these
                      sessions! They want to be the first to know. Them sponsoring = paying you to
                      do advertising on behalf of their brand.

                      Where to find: At Waterloo, we have a partnership with Contrary, a
                      relationship that was built through our organizers’ involvement in their VP
                      and Fellowship program. Twitter is also a useful platform to find other
                      potential sponsors, including student-oriented and general venture firms. Some
                      examples include <a href="https://neo.com/" class="external">Neo</a>,

                    <p>
                      Watch out for: Be cautious of firms that may take advantage of students’ lack
                      of experience. Avoid doing unpaid work for for-profit companies – ensure that
                      they are sponsoring or partnering with your agenda. If it’s their agenda, they
                      should hire someone and pay them accordingly. Be wary of requests for
                      exclusive access to the community (e.g. no other sponsors allowed) - this
                      could be seen as unpaid work for a company. Also, ensure that any firm you
                      partner with aligns with your values – remember, your partnership is an
                      endorsement, and people will trust your judgment of character.

                    university-focused accelerators are mandated to support students! Press—most new
                    accelerators &amp; funds will have some kind of public process for recruiting
                    founders. See TechCrunch/Forbes.

                    Watch out for: They might not have a budget to sponsor stuff, likely more able
                    to give you space / resources / connections. For these things, they might charge
                    money because it’s part of their business model. See venture firm red flags.

                    Where to find: Google maps! Startups close to your university are usually there
                    for a reason—seek help from those around you first! Values aligned founders and
                    companies. Word of mouth. Companies with history of supporting young /

                    not accessible via transit. Values alignment: the relationship your members may
                    have with a company you work with is deeper than that of a VC or accelerator;
                    ask yourself if you’d work for them as a potential employee &amp; if you truly
                    feel represented by them.

                    stuff that feels values aligned.

                    Watch out for: These relationships may be harder to “pass off” term over term as
                    they are highly personal and variable to individuals’ financial situations.

                      Watch out for: Make sure the effort expended: money received ratio is worth
                      it. Your time has value (especially as an organizer)! Be wary of super long
                      shot stuff, really focus on ones where you feel you are the ideal candidate
                      applying. Local stuff is great.
