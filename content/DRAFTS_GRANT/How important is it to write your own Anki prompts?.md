> [!NOTE] TLDR
As you'll notice in the references section, this topic whips up a flurry of different perspectives. My current opinion is that the best thing to do is create cards from scratch. If there isn't the emotional drive or the time required to do so, leaning on LLMs is far better than doing nothing.

There are pros and cons to creating flashcards from scratch, or using someone else's pre-created deck. The same applies to using LLMs to create them for us.

( - ) **The biggest downside to making them from scratch is the amount of time it takes to do so**. This is non-trivial. This barrier often holds me back from Ankifying the majority of things that I learn. Lowering that barrier is the point of this exploration.  

( + ) Although the time that it takes to create cards from scratch is a downside, **there are plenty of benefits**:

1.  **We grapple with and reformulate the material that we consume.** This typically requires understanding the bigger picture and then Ankifying the atomic components.
	- [ ] This is something that I'd like to pay attention to in myself. How much do I feel that this helps?
	- **Rebuttal** — This requires a front-loaded effort. Maybe we don't have the energy to do so that day. Instead of not Ankifying anything, we can lean on LLMs to do so for us.
		- Spaced repetition can help spread that effort over time (in my case, when I have trouble committing to something, this can help).
2. **We are able to fully customize what we want to remember and to how we learn best.**
	- There are several techniques for flashcard creation that are only possible when you write them for yourself. See [[List of Prompt Types]].
3. **We become more skilled Anki users.** We also develop a more complete theory of knowledge.
	- While this seems trivial, iteration and customization is what ultimately makes Anki such a powerful tool. Honing the skill of doing this for ourself is powerful.
	- Creating flashcards and noting their effectiveness has made me more aware of how memories are created and stored.

>“_Quantum Country_ violates this principle, since users are not making the cards. This violation was a major concern when we began working on _Quantum Country_. However, preliminary user feedback suggests it has worked out adequately. A possible explanation is that, as noted above, making good cards is a difficult skill to master, and so what users lose by not making their own cards is made up by using what are likely to be much higher-quality cards than they could have made on their own.”

>“The most important reason is that making Anki cards is an act of understanding in itself. That is, figuring out good questions to ask, and good answers, is part of what it means to understand a new subject well. To use someone else's cards is to forgo much of that understanding.

>Indeed, I believe the act of constructing the cards actually helps with memory. Memory researchers have repeatedly found that the more elaborately you encode a memory, the stronger the memory will be. By elaborative encoding, they mean essentially the richness of the associations you form.”

(^^ I'm not so sure that I agree with Anki only being equivalent to summarization)
