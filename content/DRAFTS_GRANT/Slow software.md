*This note and other related thoughts explore how to nudge people towards more contemplative and thoughtful uses of software.*

**outline**
- Software aims to make us more efficient but there's no built in brakes. 
	- Similar to air hockey, it's easy to end up sliding off into a certain direction and not thinking about the path
- This isn't just a problem with software, I find myself doing the same thing while reading
- What's a good clock-cycle cadence?
- What are examples of slower technology? Writing, closing one's eyes and coding
- What can be done on top of existing technology?
	- Adding in prompts to think (pomodoro style almost) - these can help build up good mental habits
- 

Whether it's crunching numbers, note taking more effectively, or communicating with others, software often aims to increase our efficiency. Far from crawling page-load times, browsers and apps offer light-speed access 

,  the rate at which technology allows us to move. 

We have no built-in clock-cycles, no way of extrapolating 

Writing is a slow technology

Anki slows down the process of learning, and has made me much more deliberate about learning about things that are important to me

# Ideas
- Slow down browser load
- Slow down how fast text actually shows up on the screen

Slowing down the computer doesn't strike me as enough. Computers used to be slow.

>“The reader lives faster than life, the **writer lives slower**.” 

—James Richardson

>"When we read, another person thinks for us: we merely repeat his mental process. … For the more one reads the fewer are the traces left of what one has read; the mind is like a tablet that has been written over and over. Hence it is impossible to reflect; and it is only by reflection that one can assimilate what one has read. If one reads straight ahead without pondering over it later, what has been read does not take root, but is for the most part lost."

—Schopenhauer
