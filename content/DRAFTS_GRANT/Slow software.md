*This and other related notes explore how to nudge people towards more contemplative and thoughtful uses of software.*

Thanks to a friend, I recently learned how to hockey stop. While I've been on the ice for my entire life and look proficient when moving fast, I've always gone in only one direction and one speed.—forward and fast. After learning to stop, I realized how much I'd been missing out on.

The company that I'm working for has a motto that is frequently repeated—"think, then do". Skating is doing. It's hard to think while skating and it's hard to think while doing, but stopping and pondering the problem is often much more fruitful.

Why mention this? The same pattern is present in other areas of my life. For example, in college, I frequently found myself skating without thinking. For example, even while coding, an activity that should require intense thinking before doing, I frequently kept typing without pausing to ponder my approach.

That's the type of thing that I want to see baked into software. There should be two modes—thinking and doing.

Software provides light speed access to an effectively infinite number of resources, capabilities, and activities. While this gives us superhuman abilities, it draws into sharp contrast the speeds at which we think and [[Our learning baseline is set too low|learn]], and our ability to skim, click through, and navigate the metaverse. So just move at the proper pace right? It's easier said than done.


The approach I'm advocating for is "think, then do".

- Similar to air hockey, it's easy to end up sliding off into a certain direction and not thinking about the path
- This isn't just a problem with software, I find myself doing the same thing while reading
- What's a good clock-cycle cadence?
- What are examples of slower technology? 
	- Writing
	- Closing one's eyes and coding
	- Both can be bettered by "thinking, then doing" (thinking mode, doing mode)
- What can be done on top of existing technology?
	- Adding in prompts to think (pomodoro style almost) - these can help build up good mental habits

- We have no built-in clock-cycles, no way of extrapolating 
- Anki slows down the process of learning, and has made me much more deliberate about learning things that are important to me

# Ideas
- Slow down browser load
- Slow down how fast text actually shows up on the screen

Slowing down the computer doesn't strike me as enough. Computers used to be slow.

>"The reason people get good ideas in the shower is because it's the only time during the day when most people are away from screens long enough to think clearly. The lesson is not to take more showers, but rather to make more time to think."

>“The reader lives faster than life, the **writer lives slower**.” 

—James Richardson

>"When we read, another person thinks for us: we merely repeat his mental process. … For the more one reads the fewer are the traces left of what one has read; the mind is like a tablet that has been written over and over. Hence it is impossible to reflect; and it is only by reflection that one can assimilate what one has read. If one reads straight ahead without pondering over it later, what has been read does not take root, but is for the most part lost."

—Schopenhauer
