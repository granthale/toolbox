After reading something, it's typical to feel confident in that which we just learned, regardless of how well we actually understand it. Many people refer to this as the Dunning-Krueger effect. See [[Our learning baseline is set too low]].

This is particularly misleading because it's the sum of several cognitive biases.

We fall victim to the effort bias. We spent time and effort consuming the information, so we value it more highly than the results warrant.

We try to alleviate cognitive dissonance. We feel as though we "should" understand the material after reading something once (even though that's preposterous). If we don't, we start to believe that we understand it better than we do.

In a similar vein, we fall victim to the self-serving bias. We often interpret results more favorably to ourself, including how strongly we thought through or read that material.

[[We have difficulty seeing those things that are not currently present]]. This makes it more difficult to see the questions that we have no answer to or the applications that we would struggle with. We often don't even have a good mental image of how well we could understand the information.
