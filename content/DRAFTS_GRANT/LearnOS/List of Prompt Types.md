There are many strategies for writing prompts. This list acts as a container to collect them.

**Strategies if you're having difficulty remembering something**
- Add in explanatory prompts
- Simplify Q or A, break up prompt into multiple questions
- Add in context (subject, etc.)
- Add in redundancy (basic + reversed cards, different wordings, derivation steps, reasoning to land at answer)
- Combat interference when you notice it
- Change sets → enumerations → meaningful prompts
- Add in images or visuals
- Go back to the basics, build up connections from those to the answer you want to remember
- Take time to understand the bigger picture and then situate the prompt within that context
- Personalize
	- Add in personal connections
	- Add in vivid memories

**Once you understand something well**
- Application prompts
	- [[Andy Matuschak|Andy]] [recommends varying these](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zSisETSpZBCgZH4rFNHRcnC) each time they're repeated
- Creativity prompts
	- Come up with an answer that you have never come up with before
	- I find this particularly useful for vocabulary

**When you want to train yourself to apply an idea**
- Salience prompts (not ideas that you're supposed to remember but ideas that are supposed to bring something to your attention the next time a situation arises). As an example:
	- A. Consume content from different mediums and perspectives
	- Q. What should I do when I feel that I'm not motivated to read a specific book, but would like to learn about a topic?

**To deepen understanding**, use [[Andy Matuschak|Andy's]] conceptual framework
1. Attributes / tendencies
2. Similarities and differences
3. Parts and wholes
4. Causes and effects
5. Significance and implications
