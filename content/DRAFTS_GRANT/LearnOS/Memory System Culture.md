>"People sometimes think about memory systems in Silicon Valley terms: what's required to build a company and tool that will make memory systems widespread? What user interface, what features, what marketing? This isn't entirely the wrong way to think about the problem. But it's more helpful to think about questions like: how did meditation and dance and yoga and basketball become popular? What would high virtuosity in the use of memory systems look like? How do we get there? And how do we rapidly transfer those skills, so people can quickly get enormous benefit out of the use of memory systems?"
