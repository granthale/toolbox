Because there is no ground-truth for excellent conceptual flashcards, the skill of Ankifying material is a difficult one to learn. This became apparent to me as I experimented with [Mark Nagleberg's GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-C8HEeoioz-flashcard-generator), and received differently worded prompts back from the LLM.

Especially as someone gets started with Anki, the learning curve can easily chew up and spit a lot of people out.

Maybe the LLM doesn't actually output the prompts themselves, but gives directions on what type of prompts could be useful to reinforce our understanding...
