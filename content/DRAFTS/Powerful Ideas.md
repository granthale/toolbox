>"For what is important when we give children a theorem to use is not that they should memorize it. What matters most is that by growing up with a few very powerful theorems, one comes to appreciate how certain ideas can be used as tools to think with over a lifetime. One learns to enjoy and to respect the power of powerful ideas. One learns that the most powerful idea of all is the idea of powerful ideas. (Location 1302)"
