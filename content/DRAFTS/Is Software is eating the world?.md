I've been doing a lot of reading about questioning the nature of software in technology, and the nature of early-stage investing more generally. 

I stumbled across this fantastic article titled 'why software is eating the world', written by Marc Andreessen, the legendary A16z co-founder and tech investor: [https://a16z.com/why-software-is-eating-the-world/](https://a16z.com/why-software-is-eating-the-world/)

A couple of thoughts:
1) This article is timeless. It really is. People may rename it to 'AI eating the world' in 2024 but fundamentally software is still so key in anything and everything we do. And so yes, I do think it has eaten the world
2) I do start to wonder whether the term 'software' actually needs to be better defined (see [[What is software?]]), or better still **redefined**. We also need to remember that tech progressions like Web3 ([[What is Web3?]]) or AI could now just be seen as having become a new tech enabler and scapegoat to the same phenomena - that software is eating the world
