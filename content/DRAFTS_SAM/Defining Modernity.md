Having provided some [[Food for thought about Papua New Guinea|food for thought about Papua New Guinea]] we have meandered our way to thinking about modernity and development. 

Some meta-questions we could keep at the back of our minds when thinking about this topic could include: 
1) What actually is *development*, and how can definitions and perceptions differ?
2) Do all countries and people strive toward *modernity*?
3) What is *anti-modernity*?
4) Is development an inherently Western-centric construct?

Furthermore, when treating definitions, [[Context is essential when creating definitions]]. So we need to remember that our context in this case is the topic of study: Papua New Guinea.

So now let's move on to defining modernity & anti-modernity. One could spend a long time debating this, as many philosophers that are much cleverer than us have done. So allow me to highlight two definitions I like, justify why, and then move back to PNG.

Britannica — an excellent resource for philosophical definitions, [defines modernity]([https://www.britannica.com/topic/modernity) as the "self-definition of a generation about its own technological innovation, governance, and socioeconomics". It continues by saying that "to participate in modernity was to conceive of one's society as engaging in organizational and knowledge advances that make one's immediate predecessors appear antiquated, or, at least, surpassed".

*I really like this as it is a very national self-determinist and decolonized viewpoint — and it also emphasizes the role of imagination in 'constructing and perceiving modernity' which is rare and so important!*

And here is an excerpt from the [Oxford University Philosophy Library]([https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100203489) (also an exceptional resource for philosophy btw), where they approach the issue from a more historiographical lens: 'Theories of modernity generally plot a shift from the traditional European societies of the Middle Ages to the political, cultural and economic forms that characterize Western, and arguably, industrialized society'.

*This is a great definition of the traditional historiographical evolution of the topic, but also fundamentally highlights how modernity is greatly intertwined with Western thought and ideals*

So how to we go about utilizing these two definitions? I much prefer the Britannica one as it is much more focused on a societal and self-deterministic viewpoint, and that will be very key when looking at PNG. But nonetheless, it does neglect the 'western influence' that the Oxford definition so importantly highlights. 

**So maybe the best thing to do is to focus on the former, but to continuously remind ourselves, and link back to, how the latter shapes the former throughout our debate.**

I'd love to have your comments on the above. What do you think about the way we have defined modernity for PNG?
