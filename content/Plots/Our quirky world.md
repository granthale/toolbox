title: ยง Our quirky world

This website would have not come about without two ingredients: 
1) A ridiculous and limitless amount of curiosity
2) A willingness to explore weird and wonderful places on our globe (both physically in-person and through a lot of reading before arriving!)

It was through a combination of these two ingredients that Grant and Sam met as Westerners curiously exploring the weird and wonderful in Taiwan in October 2023. 

So this section of the website is about us continuing to nurture our passion for reading and writing around, and sometimes even physically going to, some of the weirdest and most wonderful places in the world.
