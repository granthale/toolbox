I've already outlined and provided some food for thought as to why I find Papua New Guinea (PNG) so fascinating - [[Food for thought about Papua New Guinea]]. 

One reason why I am fascinated by it so much as it is one of the last remaining places that is extremely pure and primitive, with many of its regions are dominated by tribes. Thus, the notions of development and modernity that have swept over the world and destroyed many vestiges of such (tribal) civilisations, don't apply to Papua New Guinea. Could one then label PNG as being a society where we can talk about anti-modernity? 

This will take some exploring. One could start with exploring what anti-modernity means on a more philosophical basis ==TODO==. Or we could look at different indications of the nation being or not being modern - for starters see [[Tribal Warfare in PNG]].
