In considering [[Prompt writing principles for flashcards]], one of the more thoughtful resources is Andy Matuschak's [How to write good prompts](https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/).

**According to him, prompts should be:**
1. **Focused**
2. **Precise**
	- Make clear what the prompt is looking for
	- "poorly written prompts require that you also memorize what the prompt is asking"
3. **Consistent**
4. **Tractable**
5. **Effortful**
6. **Encoded thoroughly**
	- Attributes / tendencies
	- Similarities and differences
	- Parts and wholes
	- Causes and effects
	- Significance and implications
