>“_Quantum Country_ violates this principle, since users are not making the cards. This violation was a major concern when we began working on _Quantum Country_. However, preliminary user feedback suggests it has worked out adequately. A possible explanation is that, as noted above, making good cards is a difficult skill to master, and so what users lose by not making their own cards is made up by using what are likely to be much higher-quality cards than they could have made on their own.”

>“From a time-saving point of view, this makes little sense. **Summarization**, which is mainly what you do when creating a card by hand, is a [relatively poor learning technique](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26173288/), particularly when compared with **Distributed Practice**, the whole shtick of Spaced Repetition”
