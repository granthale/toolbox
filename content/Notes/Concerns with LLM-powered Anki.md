In trying to answer [[How important is it to create your own Anki prompts?]] it's clear that for all the benefits of an Anki copilot, there are potential downsides:

- Abusing LLMs can handicap our critical thinking ability
- Starting with an LLM can rob us of a valuable opportunity to grapple with material and come up with questions ourselves
- Hallucinations exist, making answers less trustworthy
	- Some believe that this could keep us sharper
- [[How can we direct LLM-powered SRS towards what we want to learn about?]] How can we redirect it in the direction that we want to go?

Designing a system will be about making the proper tradeoffs.
