I've long been fascinated with Papua New Guinea (PNG) as a country. I don't exactly know why, so to find out, i'm publishing some reading and writing about and around the country.

You can find some much better and more comprehensive materials around PNG [here](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/papua-new-guinea/#transnational-issues), [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea) or [here](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/top-10-interesting-facts-about-papua-new-guinea.html#:~:text=Several%20cultures%20in%20Papua%20New,every%20year%20in%20this%20country.). And theres lots more all on the web. 

But to provide some more justification as to why I am fascinated with the place, here is just a snippet of some weird and wonderful facts about the place:

- More than 860 languages are spoken within PNG's borders, and there are more than 1000 ethnic groups in PNG. And all this is for a country that has a population of 8m!
- 5% of the worlds biodiversity can be found in PNG.
- It is a country where cannibalism is still somewhat practiced.
- Until the 1960s, seashells were used as the countries currency. Only in 1975 did its national currency, the Kina, entered circulation.
- The various cities and regions in PNG are not really connected by roads. Societies are thus cut off from each other, rarely interacting. 
- Given its strong tribal roots, there are many superstitious and traditional ceremonies. The practice of 'black magic' is one, where between 50-150 woman are killed as alleged witches every year

What all these weird and wonderful facts have in common is that it is one of the last remaining places that is extremely pure and primitive - with many of its regions are dominated by tribes. Thus, the notions of development and modernity that have swept over the world and destroyed many vestiges of such (tribal) civilisations, don't apply to Papua New Guinea. Could one then label PNG as being a society where we can talk about anti-modernity? 

This will take some exploring. One could start with exploring what modernity and anti-modernity means on a more philosophical basis - see [[Defining Modernity]]. Or we could look at different indications of the nation being or not being modern - for starters take a look at [[Tribal Warfare in PNG]].
