Examples of great conceptual flashcards are hard to find. There are a few reasons for this:
1. [[Memory culture isn't widespread]], making online resources more difficult to find
2. There's not an objectively right answer. Everyone will prompt knowledge differently (this customization is a feature)
3. We're all interested in different things. Even with great examples of SRS in some domains, how do we tailor to relevant topics?

**These combine to make Anki a difficult skill to learn.**

**To point 1:** 
- Though this coordination doesn't seem to exist currently, collecting different Anki encodings of the same material—is there a platform that could be used for this?
- A general collection of ground-truth excellent flashcards (awesome-list style). One that comes to mind is [Quantum Country by Matuschak and Nielsen](https://quantum.country/)

**To point 2:**
- Maybe an LLM doesn't actually output the prompts themselves, but instead:
	1. critiques our prompts based on [[Prompt writing principles for flashcards]].
	2. gives directions on what types of prompts could be useful to reinforce our understanding.

**To point 3:**
- We can compare our Anki encoding to an LLMs response given the same information. While an LLMs output may be far from perfect, it's likely more customized than the previous options. Plus, if we're critically comparing our flashcards to the output, we should be able to recognize what makes prompts better or worse than what we've currently written. 

The LLM options create targeted "training-wheels" for users to learn from.
