When considering [[Desirable features for an GenAI-powered Anki]], the revision and [[LLMs can slowly push the boundaries of what we know|extension]] of existing prompts strikes me as one of its most potent applications. Just as copilots have sprung up in many areas of work and life, an integrated Anki copilot would enable deeper encodings of material on the fly. 

When I'm imagining this, the Anki interface looks the same. Then, like other Anki plugins, a dropdown menu enables access to different tools. These could include:

1. Andy's conceptual toolkit (attributes and tendencies, similarities and difference, parts and wholes, etc.). See [[Andy's prompt writing principles]]. These would allow for extension of a prompt and reinforcement from different angles
2. "Revise for clarity" to make a question or answer more concise or more effective. It could be broken into multiple questions at this point.
3. ...

Instead of having to identify a text's most important points, an LLM receives a question as a starting place and can work its vectorized magic with it. Copy and pasting the text the question sprung from could provide further context but doesn't seem necessary.

A more built out version could include "you might also ask..." and include several extensions of your current question.

For a non-embedded example of this, see Mark Nagleberg's [[Mark Nagelberg GPT x Anki Copilot]].
