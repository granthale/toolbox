title: technology is an idea or object that makes something easier
---
An average implicit definition of technology is something that involves electronics. And while that's one manifestation, it's far from the word's main meaning. See [[technology is not just software]]. Instead, technology is a way to make some task easier. A simple example is a lever.

See [[tech history]] for more on how we got to our present moment in time.
