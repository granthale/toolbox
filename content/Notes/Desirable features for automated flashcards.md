*This note collects ideas that LLMs could help implement.*
## From me
- To "lay down signposts" while reading. This is a reminiscent of iterative reading, with consecutive passes further encoding the text
	- I find this to be particularly useful when reading about new concepts. It often takes me a few days to internalize foundations, which is greatly accelerated by Anki
	- If an LLM could do this iteratively after ingesting a piece of material, this would be useful
- Ask questions to connect different concepts
	- Vector-encoding questions could help understand what questions to ask that are close enough to incite greater understanding
- Auto-generate Q&A from Readwise quotes
- Starting place for building on the system yourself down the line
- If you answer a  prompt is consistently wrong, add questions for context
	- From "4th president of the US?" â†’ "Who was the president before James Madison?", "Who was the president after James Madison?"
- Output LLM-created Q&A to CSV format

**[@Milan Cvitkovik](https://twitter.com/MWCvitkovic/status/1614669124424155137)**:
>- **Generate from articles or my notes** - see [example](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/sfbvbw/gpt3_can_generate_anki_cards_oo/)
>- Change the phrasing of a card each time I see it (but with exact same information). "**Muscle confusion**" for the brain.
>- **Enable interactive cards**, like short convos in a new language or multi-step terminal commands.
>- **Same concept in different contexts**
>- First, enable me to give verbal answers via transcription. Then, keep a record of my past answers, and **force me to give a new answer/phrasing to a card if my past answers are too similar**
>- **Auto-merge related cards into harder mega-cards to force chunking**. Also maybe automatically split cards into smaller concepts if I keep blowing them
>- **Rephrase the flashcard in the style of a famous person**. I want Feynman to grill me on physics in a Feynman way
>- **Inject false or impossible cards randomly** into your deck. Keep your epistemics up! If you know there's always an answer, you'll get complacent
