One of the more thoughtful resources on [[Prompt writing principles for flashcards]] is Andy Matuschak's [How to write good prompts](https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/).

**According to him, prompts should be:**
1. **Focused**
	- Only include one detail
2. **Precise**
	- Make clear what the prompt is looking for
	- "poorly written prompts require that you also memorize what the prompt is asking"
3. **Consistent**
	 - The same answer should be retrieved every time
	 - This doesn't mean the same exact words, but the same concept/idea should be activated each time
4. **Tractable**
	- You should almost always answer prompts correctly
5. **Effortful**
	- Takes effort to retrieve from memory
6. **Encoded thoroughly** (I like this conceptual framework a lot)
	1. Attributes / tendencies
	2. Similarities and differences
	3. Parts and wholes
	4. Causes and effects
	5. Significance and implications

**Useful strategies:**
- The *explanation* prompt
	- Asking why something is the case
- The *creative* prompt
	- Give an answer you haven't given before
- The *salience* prompt
	- Encode "hooks" that spark information at the right times
