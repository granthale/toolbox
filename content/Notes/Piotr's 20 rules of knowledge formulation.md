*This list adds to [[Prompt writing principles for flashcards]]. I've reworded some of Piotr's original rules. See his list [here](https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm).*

## Rules
1. **Do not learn if you do not understand**
	- He gives the example of learning history in a language you don't read/speak. You can still do it but it requires memorizing each character
2. **Comprehend the bigger picture before memorizing isolated facts**
	- I think this is true in an ideal world. In my experience, especially when spending days or weeks on a subject, a bigger picture will not readily apparent but can be bootstrapped by memorizing individual facts
		- A piece of advice I've heard is to make sure that whenever learning, to make sure that each bit of extra effort should be additive
3. **Build upon the basics**
	- Spending time learning the basics is almost never time wasted
4. **Phrase things as simply as possible. Answers should be as short as possible**
	- Simple means that each time an answer is recalled, it's recalled the same as before
	- More complex cards require more frequent review. Many people make the mistake of making their cards far too complex. 
	- Reviewing simple cards more often outweighs:
		1. Forgetting complex item over and over 
		2. Repeat it in excessively short intervals
		3. Only remembering part of the answer
5. **Cloze deletion** is one component of incremental reading! (I really like this idea). A medium could slowly remove words each time you read it
	- Parentheses can be used to hint at what's missing
	- ex. "Q: Kaleida was funded to the tune of …(amount) by Apple Computer and IBM in 1991"
6. **Visual imagery is powerful for memorization**
	- It's more difficult to find a proper image, so there are definitely tradeoffs between time/effectiveness
7. **Use mnemonic techniques**
	- [ ] Tony Buzan 
	- [ ] Mind maps
	- [ ] Peg lists
	- [ ] Mnemonic techniques
8. **Graphical deletion is just as good as cloze deletion**
9. **Avoid sets at all costs!** 
	- e.g., what countries belong to the EU? → 
	- If they are actually useful to the task at hand, enumerate the prompts so that they are recalled in the same order each time
	- If they must be used, enumerations should include overlapping cloze deletions
10. **Avoid enumerations (but use them if you have to)**
	- It can be useful to remember poems / prose by breaking things into smaller lines. See example that Piotr provides
11. **Combat interference**
	- If knowledge of one thing makes remembering something else more difficult, memory interference is at play
	 - It can be difficult to notice this at the time of writing prompts. Instead keep an eye out for it and eliminate it when it's present
12. **Fewer words speed up learning**
	- The goal is to light up the relevant lightbulb as quickly as possible
	- This harkens back to the minimum information principle. If there is more you want to remember, create more prompts
13. **Refer to other memories**
	- This can be done to actively combat the interference phenomenon
	- (e.g. adj: shamelessly humble and supplicant  → cringing)
		- These words are something that he's already memorized 
14. **Personalize and provide examples**
	- Use these examples to provide better imagery and less interference
	- (e.g., Soft bed without arms or back? (like the one at Robert’s parents) → divan)
15. **Rely on emotional states**
	- Provide examples that rely on vivid memories
	- (e.g., a light and joking conversation (e.g. Mandela and de Klerk in 1992) → banter)
16. **Context clues simplify wording**
	- Putting in tags like math, chem, etc. to help provide context for the question
	- (e.g., biochem: GRE → glucocorticoid response element)
17. **Redundancy does not contradict the minimum information principle**
	- Swap question and answer
	- Add prompts about the reasoning process
	- Derivation steps for math or science, etc.
	- Multiple semantic representations for high-value items can be useful
	- If there are multiple correct answers to a problem (e.g., synonyms in a different language), make sure that they're all accepted
18. **Include sources**
	- They don't necessarily need to be part of what you're prompting but it is illuminating to see how varied different authority's data can be
19. **Date/time stamp information if appropriate**
	- For statistical items, stamp with the year the statistics are from
20. **Prioritize**
	- With great power comes great responsibility. It's extremely easy to get bogged down memorizing everything. **A simple heuristic is to memorize the basics first**
	- This is something that makes it so powerful to choose what you'd like to work on
	- Things to prioritize based on:
		- Choose information medium purposefully (books, internet, dictionary, academic papers, etc.) these will change based on the task at hand
		- Choose to memorize "parts most likely to impact the quality of your knowledge"
		- Put optional / explanatory components of the answer in parentheses to emphasize what it is that is important to remember

## Takeaways
- Using systems like this make you think about what is actually important to remember and tests your prediction skills
- Use cases for LLMs
	- Cloze deletion (see step 4)
		- Including parentheses hinting at what's missing is important
		- This can be used as a tool for incremental reading
	- Breaking sets into meaningful prompts
	- Enumerating meaningfully (examples of alphabet or poem are most relevant)
