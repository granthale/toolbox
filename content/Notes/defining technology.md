When we invoke the word "technology", we're often implicitly referring to electronics. And while that's one illustration, it's far from the word's main meaning. See [[Technology is Not Just Software]].

Here's Miriam Webster's definition:
> the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in industry

A mechanical example is an airplane. An energetic example is a nuclear reactor. A medical one, a scalpel. And yes, no list is complete without AI.

For all that definition does well, there are ways to extend it. Reading, writing, and language are also core human technologies.

More generally, for the purposes of this blog, a technology is:

> Something that enables something to do something
