>**SRS** stands for Spaced Repetition Software.

Spaced repetition offers a powerful and simple way to reinforce learning but it takes time and energy to create cards to review.

While creating the cards is a means of reviewing the material for yourself, it would be incredibly convenient to outsource that work, or at least have a starting place to work from. Hence **LLMs**.
