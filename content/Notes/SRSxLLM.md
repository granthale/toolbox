Spaced repetition software (**SRS**) is a powerful way to reinforce what we know. But it takes time and energy to create questions to review, sometimes up to 2-3x longer than the consumption of content itself. This means friction. 

While [[Slow software|friction isn't necessarily bad]], if it keeps potential SRS users from getting started in the first place, perfect has become the enemy of good. This is also certainly not helped by our [[Our learning baseline is set too low|imaginary level of comprehension]] while learning.

So while I agree that taking the time to create our own flashcards is useful in it's own right, I'm a massive believer that most people have considerably more learning potential than they're aware of. Based on how useful Anki (a specific SRS) has been to me, making the learning curve into SRS less steep is a solid place to begin.

The question that I'm examining is - what is an easier way to onboard people into using spaced repetition. %%

Writing potent flash cards is a skill like any other. In time, it is worth developing, but as we've discussed, it presents a steep learning curve. 

**My hypothesis is that outsourcing the creation of these cards to LLMs will relieve enough effort to enable memory systems to work in practice, and at scale.**

Even if the prompts created aren't perfect, creating a starting place will help to lower the hurdle to learning more effectively.

See [[Desirable features for automated Anki flashcards]].

> "By contrast, in Quantum Country an expert writes the cards, an expert who is skilled not only in the subject matter of the essay, but also in strategies which can be used to encode abstract, conceptual knowledge. And so Quantum Country provides a much more scalable approach to using memory systems to do abstract, conceptual learning."
