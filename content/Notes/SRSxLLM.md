Spaced repetition software (**SRS**) offers a powerful and simple way to reinforce learning but it takes time and energy to create questions to review, sometimes up to 2-3x longer than just reading the content itself. And while creating the cards is a way to grapple with material and our own epistemology, it's difficult to do a great job for two reasons:

1. It's **difficult** to write good prompts
2. It takes **time** to write good prompts

Although there is a tradeoff in time grappling with the material, my hypothesis is that outsourcing the creation of those cards will relieve enough effort to enable memory systems to work in practice, and at scale.

Enter **LLMs**. Even if the prompts created aren't perfect, creating a starting place will help to lower the hurdle to learning more effectively.

> "By contrast, in Quantum Country an expert writes the cards, an expert who is skilled not only in the subject matter of the essay, but also in strategies which can be used to encode abstract, conceptual knowledge. And so Quantum Country provides a much more scalable approach to using memory systems to do abstract, conceptual learning."
