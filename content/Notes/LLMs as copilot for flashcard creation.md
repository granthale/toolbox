Beyond from-scratch creation, LLMs are promising when it comes to revision and [[LLMs can slowly push the boundaries of what we know|extension]] of existing cards. Just as copilots have been springing up in many areas of work and life, an integrated Anki copilot would enable deeper encodings of material on the fly. 

An initial vision could be the normal Anki interface, with a dropdown menu of Andy's conceptual toolkit (similarities & differences, attributes & tendencies, etc.). See [[Andy's prompt writing principles]]. After inputting a question, clicking on one of the dropdown options would generate additional prompts to reinforce it from the different angles selected.

Instead of having to identify a text's most important points, an LLM receives a question as a starting place and can work its vectorized magic with it. Copy and pasting the text the question sprung from could provide further context but doesn't seem necessary.

A more built out version could include "you might also ask..." and include several extensions of your current question.

For a non-embedded example of this, see Mark Nagleberg's [[GPT LLM Copilot Example]].
