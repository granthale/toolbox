In thinking about [[Desirable features for automating flashcard creation]], **I'd like to see Anki gently push the boundaries of what we know**.

**[@Anton](https://twitter.com/atroyn/status/1565641497524985857)** describes it like this:
>"I tell you something I want to learn about and you generate a spaced repetition program to learn that thing which adapts to my real measured progress. a.i generated quantum country"

This is very different from how using Anki manually generally works:
1. Read interesting material → input prompts into Anki
2. Review Anki → further questions often come up → input them to Anki

This classic model relies on curiosity and agency, both things that benefit from consistent use, but also the highest-energy muscles that we have.

Instead, Anki could act as the wrist-straps for a deadlift, augmenting certain muscles (in this case, question asking and content generation) while training targeted muscles (knowledge acquisition and memory).

While reliance on our own curiosity pushes our ability to ask questions and learn, it would be nice to not have to do all of the heavy lifting ourselves. See [[Concerns with LLM-powered Anki]]. I envision an LLM-supported Anki continuing to ask us questions in the direction that want, akin to a tutor.

At this point, I expect human review to be essential to maintaining high quality, on-topic prompts but our decks will be that much easier to expand.
