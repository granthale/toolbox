In thinking about [[Desirable features for automating flashcard creation]], I'd like to see Anki gently push the boundaries of what we know.

**[@Anton](https://twitter.com/atroyn/status/1565641497524985857)** describes it like this:
>"I tell you something I want to learn about and you generate a spaced repetition program to learn that thing which adapts to my real measured progress. a.i generated quantum country"

This is very different from how manual-Anki generally works:
1. Read interesting material → input prompts into Anki
2. Review Anki → further questions often come up → input them to Anki

This classic model relies on curiosity and agency, both things that benefit from consistent use, but also the highest-energy muscles that we have.

Automating learning aims to be like wrist-straps when deadlifting, augmenting certain muscles (in this case, question asking and content generation) while training big muscles (knowledge acquisition and memory).

While reliance on our own curiosity pushes our ability to ask questions and learn, it would be nice to not have to do all of the heavy lifting ourselves. See [[Concerns with LLM-powered Anki]]. I envision an LLM-supported Anki continuing to ask us questions in the direction that want, akin to a tutor.

It would likely push us in sub-optimal directions at times, so human review would still be required, but it would make the expansion of our decks that much easier.

Here's a starting place:
