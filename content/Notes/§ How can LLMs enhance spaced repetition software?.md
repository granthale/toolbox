Spaced repetition software (**SRS**) is a powerful way to reinforce what we know—I personally use Anki every day. But it takes time and energy to create questions to review, sometimes up to 2-3x longer than the consumption of content in the first place. 

While [[Slow software|friction isn't necessarily bad (especially in software)]], if this keeps potential users of SRS from getting started in the first place, perfect has become the enemy of good. This is also certainly not helped by our often [[Our learning baseline is set too low|imagined level of comprehension]] while learning.

So while creating flashcards from scratch is a good way to grapple with material, there are a couple things to note:
1. Using Anki and other SRSs effectively requires a steep learning curve
2. Making high quality cards can take a lot of time, even after becoming more skilled

That's why as part [Kernel](https://www.kernel.community/en/), I'm looking into ways of augmenting flashcard creation and revision.

**My hypothesis is that outsourcing the creation and revision of these cards to LLMs will relieve enough effort to enable memory systems to work in practice, and at scale.** 

This page is just the beginning. See [[Desirable features for automating flashcard creation]],  [[Prompt writing principles for flashcards]], or [[How important is it to create your own Anki prompts?]]

And so Quantum Country provides a much more scalable approach to using memory systems to do abstract, conceptual learning."
