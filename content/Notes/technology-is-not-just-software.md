title: technology is not just software
---
To define "technology" as information software is a disservice. See [[technology is an idea or object that makes something easier]].

Not only is it definitionally incorrect but it's conceptually misleading. It fails to include some of humanities biggest technological achievements, including the collective quality of life increase in the last century.
