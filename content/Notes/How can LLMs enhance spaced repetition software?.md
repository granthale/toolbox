Spaced repetition software (**SRS**) is a powerful way to reinforce what we know. But it takes time and energy to create questions to review, sometimes up to 2-3x longer than the consumption of content itself. 

So while [[Slow software|friction isn't necessarily bad (especially in software)]], if it keeps potential SRS users from getting started in the first place, perfect has become the enemy of good. This is also certainly not helped by our often [[Our learning baseline is set too low|imagined level of comprehension]] while learning.

I agree that taking the time to create our own flashcards is useful in it's own right and I'm a big fan of doing so myself. But I also believe that most people leave considerable learning potential on the table. That's why as part of my [Kernel](https://www.kernel.community/en/) adventure, I'm looking into easier ways to onboard people into spaced repetition.

More specifically, **my hypothesis is that outsourcing the creation of these cards to LLMs will relieve enough effort to enable memory systems to work in practice, and at scale.** 

See [[Desirable features for automated flashcards]] and [[Prompt writing principles for flashcards]].

And so Quantum Country provides a much more scalable approach to using memory systems to do abstract, conceptual learning."
