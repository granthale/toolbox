1. **We mull over and grapple with the material that we consume.** This typically requires understanding the bigger picture and then Ankifying its atomic components.
2. **We are able to fully customize what we want to remember and to how we learn best.** There are several techniques for flashcard creation that are only possible when you write them for yourself. See [[List of Prompt Types]].
3. **We become more skilled Anki users.** We also develop a more complete theory of knowledge. While this seems trivial, iteration and customization is what ultimately makes Anki such a powerful tool. Honing the skill of doing this for ourselves is powerful.
	- Creating flashcards and noting their effectiveness has made me more aware of how memories are created and stored.

>“The most important reason is that making Anki cards is an act of understanding in itself. That is, figuring out good questions to ask, and good answers, is part of what it means to understand a new subject well. To use someone else's cards is to forgo much of that understanding.

>Indeed, I believe the act of constructing the cards actually helps with memory. Memory researchers have repeatedly found that the more elaborately you encode a memory, the stronger the memory will be. By elaborative encoding, they mean essentially the richness of the associations you form.”
