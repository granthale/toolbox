When someone invokes the word "technology", they're often implicitly referring to electronics. And while that's one illustration, it's far from the word's main meaning. See [[technology is not just software]].

I like Miriam Webster's definition:

> the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in industry

A mechanical example is an airplane. A more energetic example is a nuclear reactor. Medically, a scalpel. And, thanks for your patience, AI is indeed a technology.

For all that definition does well, there are many ways to extend it. I would also include reading, writing, and language as core human technologies.

More generally, for the purposes of this blog, a technology is:

> Something that enables something to do something
