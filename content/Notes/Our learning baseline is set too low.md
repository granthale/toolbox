A continuously difficult task is to evaluate how well we've learned something. Education researchers bucket this under metacognition.

Unfortunately with regard to reading, our evolution actively conspires against us. See [[Reading produces satisfaction, regardless of how well we understand]]. 

However, further compounding this, we commonly substitute "did I learn from this book?" with "did I pass my eyeballs over the entire book?" 

If learning is the goal, this is not the system to use. Raise the bar to raise intellect. See [[Set a higher learning baseline for yourself]].
