In thinking about [[Desirable features for automating flashcard creation]], I'd like to see Anki gently push what we know.

**[@Anton](https://twitter.com/atroyn/status/1565641497524985857)** describes it like this:
>"I tell you something I want to learn about and you generate a spaced repetition program to learn that thing which adapts to my real measured progress. a.i generated quantum country"

This is very different from how Anki is generally used:
1. Read interesting material, input prompts into Anki
2. Review Anki. At this time, further questions often arise. Answer and input them to Anki

While reliance on our own curiosity pushes our ability to ask questions and learn, it would be nice to not have to do all of the heavy lifting ourselves. I envision an LLM-supported Anki continuing to ask us questions in the direction that want, akin to a tutor.

It would likely push us in sub-optimal directions at times, so human review would still be required, but it would make the expansion of our decks that much easier.
