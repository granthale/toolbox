Partially because memory culture isn't well-developed, great examples of conceptual flashcards are difficult to find. Unlike learning to play the piano, where even while improvising, there are endless hours of incredible music to compare yourself to, great flashcards can be difficult to find. This makes Anki a difficult skill to learn.

There are a few different ways I can think to solve this problem:
1. One is to collect different people's Anki encodings of the same material (arguably the best way), though this requires coordination that currently doesn't seem to exist.
2. A second is a general collection of ground-truth excellent flashcards (awesome-list style). One that comes to mind is [Quantum Country by Matuschak and Nielsen](https://quantum.country/)
3. A third is to compare our Anki encoding to an LLMs given the same information. While an LLMs output may be far from perfect, it's far more accessible and customized than the previous options. Plus, if we're critically comparing our flashcards to the output, we should be able to recognize what makes prompts better or worse than what we've currently written. 
4. Maybe the LLM doesn't actually output the prompts themselves, but gives directions on what types of prompts could be useful to reinforce our understanding

The latter two place LLMs in a "training-wheel" position for users of memory systems.
