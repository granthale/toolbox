> **"The skill of writing is to create a context in which other people can think"**

â€” Edwin Schlossberg

## Thesis

As you peruse, you'll notice that this isn't your average blog. Full essays are rare. Instead, connected atomic ideas are the norm. This writing style goes by many names - [evergreen](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes), [zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/overview/), and [second brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) are a few. We prefer [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).

Here's the talented [Maggie Appleton's](https://maggieappleton.com) visual description:

We chose this format because **we believe that the chronological blog is an artifact of the past**. Powerful ideas stay relevant and thus will continue to resurface as they're built on. See _recent notes_ and _recent writing_ to follow up on this.

## Who's we?

Our names are [[Authors/Grant]] & [[Authors/Sam]]. We're two good friends in the early stages of life. We met in 2023 while backpacking through Taiwan, and are now back at work in the US and Switzerland respectively. Despite busy professional lives, we're continuing to learn and think by asking and answering dynamic questions. This website is the fruit of that pursuit.

## Onwards and upwards!

Here's to powerful ideas, thoughtful writing, and good coffee! See ya around!
