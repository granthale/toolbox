# Thesis

We believe that the chronological blog is an artifact of the past. Instead we believe in work in progress and keeping the garage door open. We don't wait until an answer is fully grown. We write above, below, and around powerful questions.

# Gardening

We write by gardening. In each topic's case, a seed is planted. From that moment on, the questions generated become the sustaining nutrients. [include something about how this gives people context on what we're thinking].

These seeds will grow into saplings, and with enough patience into full-fledged trees which will take the form of different answers and perspectives.

# About Us

As for who we are, our names are Grant and Sam. We're two good friends in the early stages of our life. We met in 2023 while backpacking through Taiwan, and are now back at work as Consultants in the US and Switzerland respectively. Despite busy professional lives, we're still trying to hone our ability to learn and think by asking and answering meaningful questions.

# Purpose

To a large degree, this platform is an attempt to map our cognitive models and thinking styles, whilst simultaneously answering meaningful questions. Here’s an example...

To an almost equal degree, the platform is also an attempt to help others think differently about certain topics, through the way topics are deconstructed by our garden of curiosities.

In short, this website does two things.

<ol>
    <li>It provides a platform for displayed and deconstructed curiosities.</li>
    <li>
    It gives room for intellectuals and entrepreneurs to build and grow on knowledge in the style of a digital garden, and through this, come to think about anything and everything in a more sophisticated way.
