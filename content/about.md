## Thesis

In short, this website gives room for intellectuals and entrepreneurs to build and grow on knowledge in the style of a digital garden.

We believe that **the chronological blog is an artifact of the past**. Pieces and notes on this platform will continue to evolve over time, mirroring the similar process with ideas. It is very much work in progress and we love interaction with readers.

This approach reduces the barrier for you to hear from us and allows a more accurate representation of our thinking over time.

## Gardening

How exactly does this work? We write by [gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).

- [ ] TODO

You'll notice that there are several types of notes:

1. Seed
2. Budding
3. Evergreen

## About Us

As for who we are, our names are Grant and Sam.

We're two good friends in the early stages of life. We met in 2023 while backpacking through Taiwan, and are now back at work as Consultants in the US and Switzerland respectively.

Despite busy professional lives, we're still trying to hone our ability to learn and think by asking and answering meaningful questions.

## Purpose

To a large degree, this website is an attempt to showcase our thinking in public. We are also hoping to help you gain easy entry points into topics that we find fascinating.
