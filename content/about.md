> **"The skill of writing is to create a context in which other people can think"**

â€” Edwin Schlossberg

## Thesis

We give room to young intellectuals and entrepeneurs to develop knowledge in the style of a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).

**We believe that the chronological blog is an artifact of the past**. Just as essays don't appear fully written, mature thoughts take time and energy to grow.

To grow these ideas in public, we write in an [evergreen](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) format. This removes much of the friction in the writing process and gives you (the reader) a glimpse into our thinking. Here's the talented [Maggie Appleton's](https://maggieappleton.com) visual description:

## Who's writing?

Our names are [[Grant]] & [[Sam]]. We're two good friends in the early stages of life. We met in 2023 while backpacking through Taiwan, and are now back at work in the US and Switzerland respectively.

Despite busy professional lives, we're still trying to hone our ability to learn and think by asking and answering meaningful questions. This website is the fruit of that pursuit.

## Closing Thoughts

Finally, check out the people who inspired this website. We owe them a hell of a lot and know that if you enjoy our garden you'll certainly enjoy theirs.
