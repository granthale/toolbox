I went off to the Caucuses a few weeks back and spent some time reading up on various aspects of their brutal, eclectic and overlooked histories. I found [this story]([https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68055420](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68055420)) particularly interesting, and next to its moving theme, it in catalysed two curiosities in me. Firstly about the brutal and relatively unknown histories of child trafficking and missing babies in Georgia. Second, it ones again demonstrated how [technology has fundamentally reshaped our lives](technology has fundamentally reshaped our lives) - and is also playing a key role in helping uncover and bring to light issues from our past.
