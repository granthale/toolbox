**Web1.0** is often referred to as the "read-only" web. Web pages were generally built for consumption but not for interaction. 

**Web2.0** provided the rich interactivity on the web that we partake in today. Companies like Facebook, Twitter, Uber and Airbnb are prototypical web2 candidates.

What's left? We can consume. We can create. But what **Web3.0** adds is the ability to trust.==TODO==

Web3 is about decentralizing applications to make the web more robust and private. 

Robust is important. websites are up for average of 100 days
